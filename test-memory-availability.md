<assistant_memory>
<action>read</action>
</assistant_memory>
```

## Test 2: Write Memory

## What to Check

1. **Console Logs**: Open browser console (F12) and look for:
   - "Mode config:" - Should show current mode
   - "Mode groups:" - Should include "memory" group
   - "Processing group: memory" - Should appear
   - "Adding tool: assistant_memory" - Should appear
   - "Final tools set:" - Should include "assistant_memory"

2. **Tool Execution**: Should see:
   - "Assistant memory tool called:" in console
   - File creation/modification logs
   - Success messages

3. **File Creation**: Check if `assistant-memory.md` is created in vault root

## Expected Behavior

- ✅ Tool should be available in system prompt
- ✅ Tool should execute when called
- ✅ File should be created/modified
- ✅ Console logs should show detailed debugging info

If the tool still doesn't work, the console logs will help us identify exactly where the issue is.
